docker build -t hbnb-clone .

# Run the container
docker run -p hbnb-clone

```

## Dependencies & Environment Setup

### It is recommended to use a virtual environment for this project. Set one up using:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

This project was built using Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm). All necessary dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install these dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To know wich dependencies you have in your project use
the command and create a file with all the dependencies you have: 
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Consistency Across Environments
To ensure consistency across various development environments and in preparation for production, consider:

- Locking Dependencies: Use tools like pipenv or Poetry to lock your project to specific library versions, preventing incompatible updates.

- Using Docker: For enhanced consistency, especially for production, encapsulate your application within Docker containers. This ensures that it runs identically on any system.

## UML Diagram Overview

## Integration of Flask-RESTx

In this project, we have transitioned from using Flask's Blueprint system to Flask-RESTx for defining our API routes and logic. This change enhances the structure and functionality of our application by utilizing Flask-RESTx's extended capabilities.

### Why Flask-RESTx Over Blueprints?

Flask-RESTx is an extension for Flask that adds support for quickly building REST APIs. It encourages best practices and handles much of the boilerplate code for setting up API routes, request validation, and response marshalling.

### Benefits of Using Flask-RESTx

- **Simplified Data Marshalling**: Automatically marshal and unmarshal data according to predefined schemas. This ensures that incoming and outgoing data is formatted correctly, reducing errors and simplifying data handling.
  
- **Automatic Documentation**: Flask-RESTx integrates with Swagger to provide out-of-the-box API documentation. This makes it easier for developers to understand and use the API, as all available endpoints, parameters, and expected request/response formats are well-documented.
  
- **Input Payload Validation**: Flask-RESTx allows for easy input validation, ensuring that received data meets the API’s requirements before processing. This reduces the amount of error handling code needed in the business logic.
  
- **Resourceful Routing**: Utilize the resourceful routing provided by Flask-RESTx to organize API endpoints more intuitively. This aligns API design with REST standards, making it more maintainable and scalable.
  
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling capabilities with built-in handlers in Flask-RESTx, which can be customized for different types of exceptions. This feature standardizes API error responses, making the API more reliable and easier to debug.

### Transitioning from Blueprints to Flask-RESTx

Transitioning from Blueprints to Flask-RESTx involves defining `Namespace` objects instead of `Blueprints`, and `Resource` classes instead of route functions. Each `Resource` class encapsulates the logic for a specific part of the API, promoting clean separation of concerns and making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

Here's a simple example of how a Flask Blueprint route might be transformed into a Flask-RESTx Resource:

```python
# Using Flask Blueprint
from flask import Blueprint
blueprint = Blueprint('example', __name__)

@blueprint.route('/example', methods=['GET'])
def get_example():
    return "Example data"

# Using Flask-RESTx
from flask_restx import Resource, Api, Namespace
api = Namespace('example')

@api.route('/example')
class ExampleResource(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return "Example data"
```
## Command for initialize App and Pytest
### Command to initialize APP

```bash
python3 -m app.your_app
```

## Command to run tests
Make sure you are in the route directorie of the project

```bash
python -m pytest tests/services/test_name.py
```

## Essential Docker Commands
Building and Running the Docker Container

### Build Image:
Compile your Dockerfile into a Docker image. This is needed to create the runnable instance of your application.

```bash
docker build -t your_app .
```
### Listing Docker Images
To see all Docker images stored on your machine, use the following command:

```bash
docker images
```

```bash
docker images | grep your_app
```

### Run Container:
Start the application in a new container, mapping the internal port to one accessible on the host.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8000 your_app
```

### Container Management
### View Running Containers:
See what containers are currently active.

```bash
docker ps
```

### Stop Container:
Terminate a running container gracefully.

```bash
docker stop [container_id]
```

### Remove Container:
Delete a stopped container to clean up your system.

```bash
docker rm [container_id]
```

### Debugging
### View Logs:
Check the output from your container, useful for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.
```bash
docker logs [container_id]
```

### Note
Replace [container_id] with the actual ID of your container as necessary.
Run these commands from the directory that includes your Dockerfile, or specify the path appropriately.
